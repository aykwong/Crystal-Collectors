# Crystal Collectors

Crystal Collectors is a game where the objective is for the user to achieve the computer generated target. Through pressing the jewels, the user's score will go up by a pre-set amount associated with each jewel. If the user scores and achieves the target, the wins will go up by one. If the user goes over the target, the losses will go up by one. Afterwards the game will reset and the user will be able to play again with newly generated values of each jewel.
